/** @mainpage ðŸŒ€ PICurv: A Parallel Particle-in-Cell Solver for Curvilinear LES
@brief PICurv is a parallel particle-in-cell (PIC) solver designed for low-Mach-number turbulent flows in complex geometries. Built using PETScâ€™s DMDA and DMSwarm infrastructure, it features:
- A fractional-step incompressible Navierâ€“Stokes solver with dynamic Smagorinsky LES
- Support for body-fitted curvilinear grids and immersed boundaries (CURVIB)
- Fully MPI-parallel particle tracking with two-way Eulerianâ€“Lagrangian coupling
- Trilinear interpolation (grid â†’ particle) and conservative face-based projection (particle â†’ grid)

The solver has been validated on canonical geometries such as curved pipes and demonstrates scalable performance for millions of particles on both structured Cartesian and curvilinear meshes.

@section gettingstarted ðŸš€ Getting Started 
- Dependencies: PETSc 3.20.3 or newer (Built with MPI and 'DMSWARM' support).
- Build:
To build the solver and postprocessor:

```bash
make inttest       # Builds main solver executable `inttest`
make postprocess   # Builds postprocessor executable `postprocess`
```

Ensure PETSc paths are configured correctly in your Makefile or environment.
