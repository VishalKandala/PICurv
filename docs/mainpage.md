# ðŸŒ€ PICurv: A Hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian Framework for Scalar Transport

Welcome to the documentation for **PICurv**, a high-performance, parallel framework for simulating turbulent flows with actively coupled scalar fields using a hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian method.

PICurv is designed to tackle complex scalar transport problems where traditional grid-based methods suffer from numerical diffusion. It couples a curvilinear immersed boundary (CurvIB) fluid dynamics solver with a parallel Lagrangian particle method. In this framework, "particles" act as moving computational points that carry and evolve scalar properties. These properties are then projected back onto the Eulerian grid, creating a powerful two-way coupling. This makes PICurv an ideal platform for advanced simulations in turbulent mixing and combustion, such as transported Probability Density Function (t-PDF) or Flamelet/Progress Variable (FPV) models.

@section methodology_sec Core Methodology

PICurv's methodology is a tightly integrated, two-way coupled hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian scheme. It solves for the fluid mechanics on a stationary grid while tracking the evolution of scalar fields on a vast number of moving Lagrangian markers.

### 1. The Eulerian Phase (The Grid)

The background fluid flow is handled by the **CurvIB solver**, which employs a pressure-based **fractional-step projection method** for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Turbulence is modeled using Large Eddy Simulation (LES). The grid also hosts Eulerian scalar fields (`phi_field`), which are constructed from the properties of the Lagrangian markers.

### 2. The Lagrangian Phase (The Markers)

The core of the scalar transport model resides in the Lagrangian phase, which consists of millions of computational markers. These are abstract, massless markers that act as carriers of scalar information (`phi_particle`). An evolution equation is solved for the scalar properties along each marker's trajectory, with parallel management handled by PETSc's `DMSwarm`.

### 3. The Two-Way Coupling Mechanism

The true power of PICurv lies in the continuous, two-way exchange of information between the grid and the markers.

-   **Grid â†’ Marker (Interpolation):** Fluid velocity and other Eulerian properties are interpolated to each marker's location to advect it and evaluate source terms in its governing equation.
-   **Marker â†’ Grid (Projection):** The Eulerian scalar field is reconstructed from the Lagrangian marker properties using cell averaging. This allows the high-resolution, non-diffusive information from the particles to directly influence the grid-based fields.
