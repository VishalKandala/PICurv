/**
 * @brief Sets the initial values for the INTERIOR of a specified Eulerian field.
 *
 * This function initializes the interior nodes of `Ucont` based on a profile selected
 * by `user->FieldInitialization`. It explicitly skips any node that lies on a global
 * boundary, as those values are set by the Boundary System's `Initialize` methods.
 *
 * The initialization is directional, aligned with the primary INLET face that was
 * identified by the parser. This ensures the initial flow is physically meaningful.
 *
 * Supported `user->FieldInitialization` profiles for "Ucont":
 *  - 0: Zero Velocity. All interior components of Ucont are set to 0.
 *  - 1: Constant Normal Velocity. The contravariant velocity component normal to the
 *       inlet direction is set such that the physical velocity normal to those grid
 *       planes is a constant `uin`. Other contravariant components are zero.
 *  - 2: Poiseuille Normal Velocity. The contravariant component normal to the
 *       inlet direction is set with a parabolic profile.
 *
 * @param user      The main UserCtx struct, containing all simulation data and configuration.
 * @param fieldName A string ("Ucont" or "P") identifying which field to initialize.
 * @return PetscErrorCode 0 on success.
