 *
 * The function follows a strict sequence:
 * 1.  **Allocate Context & Set Defaults:** It first allocates the `SimulationContext`
 *     and populates every field with a sane, hardcoded default value. This
 *     ensures the simulation starts from a known, predictable state.
 * 2.  **Configure Logging System:** It configures the custom logging framework. It
 *     parses the `-func_config_file` option to load a list of function names
 *     allowed to produce log output. This configuration (the file path and the
 *     list of function names) is stored within the `SimulationContext` for
 *     later reference and cleanup.
 * 3.  **Parse All Options:** It performs a comprehensive pass of `PetscOptionsGet...`
 *     calls for every possible command-line flag, overriding the default
 *     values set in step 1.
 * 4.  **Log Summary:** After all options are parsed, it uses the now-active
 *     logging system to print a summary of the key simulation parameters.
 *
 * @param[in]  argc      Argument count passed from `main`.

 *                       is responsible for eventually destroying this object by
 *                       calling `FinalizeSimulation()`.
